# Troubleshooting

`shell-config` saves logs for each action that has been executed, as well as errors that may have occurred. You can find and search through the logs with the following command:

```bash
tail ~/shell-config/logs/macos-setup.log
```

If you are having trouble with a specific action, you can search for the action name in the log file to see what went wrong.

If you are still having trouble, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Avivbens/shell-config/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=).
Attaching your logs might help us understand the issue better.
